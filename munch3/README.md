# Munching Square

Variant on Munch2 composites a simple, moving white muncher over the
pattern from Munch2.

## Description of Munch2

Tried some ideas from [Scanlime's recent
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxtYy0Wb1S0).

The three color channels run at different speeds.  There
are gaps in the animation.  And there's a little bit of
fading (but a different effect from Scanlimes's).
